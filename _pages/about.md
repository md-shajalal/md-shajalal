I am PhD Research Fellow at [Fraunhofer FIT](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/), Germany, under the prestigious Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship (MSCA ITN), focusing on Human-centered explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for my PhD research. Before joining Fraunhofer FIT, I was a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at HSTU, and I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from TUT, Japan under the prestigious MEXT scholarship, with a thesis on identifying diverse query intents for ambiguous and under-specified search queries. My research interests are in the field of XAI, Information Retrieval (IR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have served as a faculty member at Bangladesh Agricultural University and Bangladesh Army University of Science and Technology and also have one year of experience as a software engineer.
